title: Bootstrap Blog Phase 2 - Complete
date: 2014-03-03

Phase II of the blog re-write using Jekyll and Bootstrap is complete.  Like all things, this site, this blog, is a continuous work in progress.  A constantly evolving and adapting presence.

The latest update changes the color scheme (I call it Miami Vice) and I also applied the bootstrap framework, jekyll layouts and the style changes to the [project](proj) page. The [about](about) page is still a laggard.

One great discovery about Jekyll - the front-matter properties can contain HTML snippets.  Pretty handy!

Next Step: Convert about page.
