Over the past week I've migrated my old site, previously hosted on Google Apps, to this newly rebooted site on GitHub Pages.  The 
transition was quite easy.  I've also updated the site to take advantage of the GitHub static site generator Jekyll.  This is still 
a work in progress as I recreate portions of the site as layouts, templates, includes, etc.
