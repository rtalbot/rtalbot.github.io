title: Site Update

Over the past week I've migrated my old site, previously hosted on Google Apps, to this newly rebooted site on GitHub Pages.  The 
transition was quite easy and I'm really digging the ease of deployment and maintenance.  

I've also updated the site to take advantage of the GitHub static site generator [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).  This is still a work in progress as I recreate portions of the site according to the Jekyll model (using layouts, templates, includes).  So far I've really enjoyed using Jekyll.  It's simple and simple is good.
