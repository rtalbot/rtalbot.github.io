I think my next step for the site will be to start using a CSS framework, in particular bootstrap, because:

* My hand-crafted CSS is bullshit
* Bootstrap has huge market penetration - when you think CSS framework you think what?
* It's a great portable skill set to have in my repertoire
* It helps guarantee alignment to standards
* It's loads from a CDN
* And finally, did I mention that my hand-crafted CSS is bullshit?

I expect to have the bootstrap changes done in the next week.  Boom!
