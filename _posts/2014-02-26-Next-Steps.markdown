My next step for the site will be to start using the Bootstrap CSS framework because:

* My hand-crafted CSS is bullshit.  Harsh? Maybe but I'm not really a "front-end guy".  I'm great on the back-end - building great application functionality, workng with data, troubleshooting issues, etc.  I'm 1st to admit that CSS isn't my strong-suit so I'll take advantage of a framework which let's me be more powerful with it and helps guide me into doing it right.
* Bootstrap has huge market penetration.  When you think CSS framework you think what?  Honestly, I probably haven't done sufficient homework in this space cause I'm coming up blank...Meteor, maybe? Or another swiss-army knife framework?  No Thanks I don't want THAT much prescription and constrain.  
* It's a great portable skill set to have in my repertoire.  And having bad ass skills is what it's all about.  Seriously, if I didn't love the learning treadmill that is the tech industry well I guess I'd find another job? Or maybe learn COBOL or something.
* Insert something here about alignment to standards, best practices, semantic mark-up and all those other good things that we should all care about.  
* AND I get it off the CDN which is great for performance and maintaining version.  Doesn't get better than that when you're offloading responsibility!
* And finally, did I mention that my hand-crafted CSS is bullshit?  And shit don't render.  Well, it does but it could be better.

Boom! Encouragement!
