I think my next step for the site will be to start using a CSS framework, in particular bootstrap, because:

* My hand-crafted CSS is bullshit
* Bootstrap has huge market penetration.  When you think CSS framework you think what?  Which leads to...
* It's a great portable skill set to have in my repertoire.  Cause having skills is what it's all about.
* It also helps guarantee alignment to standards
* It's loads from a CDN which is good for performance and all that
* And finally, did I mention that my hand-crafted CSS is bullshit?  And shit don't render.

I expect to have the bootstrap changes done in the next week.  Boom!
