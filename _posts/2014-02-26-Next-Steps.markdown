I think my next step for the site will be to start using a CSS framework, in particular bootstrap, because:

1.) My hand-crafted CSS is bullshit
2.) Bootstrap has huge market penetration - when you think CSS framework you think what?
3.) It's a great portable skill set to have in my repertoire
4.) It helps guarantee alignment to standards
5.) It's loads from a CDN
6.) And finally, did I mention that my hand-crafted CSS is bullshit?

I expect to have the bootstrap changes done in the next week.  Boom!
