title: Bootstrap Blog Phase 1 - Complete

Ok, Phase I of the conversion to bootstrap is complete.  All I've done here is a copy-pasta of the [Bootstrap Blog Template](http://getbootstrap.com/examples/blog/) and applied that to my Jekyll layouts and includes.  If you want details of how this looks grab my [site code](http://github.com/rtalbot/rtalbot.github.io) and take a peek at default.html and the html files in _includes.

Couldn't have been easier.  Unfortunately, the result at this point is rather boring and I've broken the other pages - OH NO!  On to Phase II (Bug fixes and a little personal style)...
