Hi, my name is Richard J Talbot and this is my internet home. Thanks for visiting my site.

I program, explore data, work with ML models and try to write about it. More information can be found through <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/" data-network="LinkedIn" data-proofer-ignore>LinkedIn.</a>

## The Website
This site was made on an [Apple MBP](https://www.apple.com/) using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/git s) powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com).
I'd love to hear your feedback on this site and my work.
